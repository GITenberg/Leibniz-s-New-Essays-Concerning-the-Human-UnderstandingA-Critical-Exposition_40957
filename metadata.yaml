description: '"The purpose of the series of which the present volume is one, is not,
  as will be seen by reference to the statement in the initial volume, to sum up in
  toto the system of any philosopher, but to give a "critical exposition" of some
  one masterpiece. In treating the "Nouveaux Essais" of Leibniz, I have found myself
  obliged, at times, to violate the letter of this expressed intention, in order to
  fulfil its spirit. The "Nouveaux Essais," in spite of its being one of the two most
  extended philosophical writings of Leibniz, is a compendium of comments, rather
  than a connected argument or exposition. It has all the suggestiveness and richness
  of a note-book, but with much also of its fragmentariness. I have therefore been
  obliged to supplement my account of it by constant references to the other writings
  of Leibniz, and occasionally to take considerable liberty with the order of the
  treatment of topics. Upon the whole, this book will be found, I hope, to be a faithful
  reflex not only of Leibniz''s thought, but also of his discussions in the "Nouveaux
  Essais." I have endeavored, in the body of the work, to identify my thought with
  that of Leibniz as much as possible, to assume his standpoint and method, and, for
  the most part, to confine express criticism upon his limitations to the final chapter.
  In particular, I have attempted to bring out the relations of philosophy to the
  growing science of his times, to state the doctrine of pre-established harmony as
  he himself meant it, and to give something like consistency and coherency to his
  doctrine of material existence and of nature. This last task seemed especially to
  require doing. I have also endeavored to keep in mind, throughout, Leibniz''s relations
  to Locke, and to show the "Nouveaux Essais" as typical of the distinction between
  characteristic British and German thought"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
